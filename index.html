          <p>Life is fair. We all get the same nine-month shake in the box, and
             then the dice roll. Some people get a run of sevens. Some people,
              unfortunately, get snake-eyes. Its just how the world is. </p>

              <h2>*Description*</h2>
              <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>

              <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
              <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
              <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
              <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</li>

              <p>For example, the first player,Garad, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Garad could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again.
              Garad rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Garad rolls a 1, and must end his turn
              without scoring. The next player, Nasteha, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.</p>

                   <h3><em>Banter</em></h3>
             <p>It was the habit in some rural areas of old Egypt that a groom before his wedding night would hide a cat in his room.
                On the wedding night, when alone with his wife, he would move a chair slightly to so as to free the cat.
                 He would then demonstrate his might to his wife by getting hold of the poor cat and strangling it to death! Why?
                 So that the first impression of him imprinted in the mind of his wife would be one of awe!</p>
                        <h3> #Solitary</h3>
                 <p>As a child I felt myself to be alone, and I am still, because I know things and must hint at things
                    which others apparently know nothing of, and for the most part do not want to know</p>

        <h3>People are like the minerals of the earth</h3>
       <P>If we reflect upon our experiences with others,we find that people have different natures like the varying nature of the land.
         There are those who are soft, and those who are hard. There are those who are generous, like a fertile land, and those who are
          miserly, like a barren field that can neither hold water, nor produce fruit. People, therefore, differ immensely. On reflection,
          we know that various terrains are traversed in different ways. The manner in which solid ground is walked upon is certainly not
           the way soft ground is. One would be relaxed walking on the former while apprehensive on the latter. Human beings are of a similar nature.
            The Prophet (SAW) said, "Allah created Adam from a handful of dust taken from different lands, so the children of Adam have been created
            according to the composition of the land. Therefore from mankind we have red, white, black and what comes in between these; we have good
             and evil, easygoing and sorrowful." (Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi who said it Hasan Sahih) Bear this in mind when dealing with others whether
              they are close, such as fathers, mothers, wives or children, or otherwise, such as neighbours, colleagues or even shopkeepers.
         People's various natures and temperaments have an effect on their decisions. To prove this point, carry out the following experiment:
          If you ever have a problem with your wife, ask a friend of yours, whom you know to be harsh, for advice. Say to him, "My wife is giving
           me problems. She does not treat me with respect. What should I do?" He would probably respond with, "Women can only be controlled by terror,
            fury and rage! Have a strong personality and show her that you are a man!‚Äù If you follow this advice, you may subsequently return home and
            as a result, break up your family. Now, try another friend whom you know to be soft and gentle. Tell him what you told your previous friend.
             You will find that he would probably say something like, "Dear brother, she is the mother of your children. All marriages have problems.
             Have patience with her regardless of what happens. She is, after all, your wife and your life partner." Note how a person's nature affects
              his views and decisions. For this reason, the Prophet (SAW) forbade that a judge should pass a verdict when he is either thirsty, hungry
              or even feeling the urge to answer the call of nature. This is because these matters may affect a person, and subsequently
               influence his decisions and judgements.</p>
